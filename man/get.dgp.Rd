\usage{
get.dgp(n, d, pos = 0.01, minATE = -2, minBV = 0, depth, maxterms,
  minterms, mininters, num.binaries = floor(d/4), force.confounding = TRUE,
  skewing = c(-1, 1))
}
\arguments{
\item{n, }{sample size}

\item{d, }{dimension of potential confounders}

\item{pos, }{a small value to make sure prop scores are in (pos, 1 - pos)}

\item{minATE, }{minimum causal risk difference for the population.}

\item{minBV, }{minimum blip variance for population}

\item{depth, }{specify depth of interaction--must be less than or equal d.}

\item{maxterms, }{maximum terms per interaction.  For example, this would limit 
two way interactions to maximally 10 terms as well as three way or main terms.
With high dimension it is wise to set this low because it might take a while
otherwise.  Still in development--perhaps future will set this for each depth}

\item{minterms}{sets a minimum number of total covariate terms, including 
interactions with eachother--do not set lower than 1.}

\item{mininters}{sets the minimum number of interactions with treatment to include
This must be bigger or equal to minterms}

\item{num.binaries}{specifies number of main terms you want as binaries, must be 
less than d.}

\item{force.confounding}{forces variables used for p-score to overlap with those
used for outcome regression.}

\item{skewing}{randomly skews an otherwise centered dgp for generating binary treatment
default is c(-1, 1).  Set to c(-5,-1) to deliberately skew more regularly or widen to 
c(-3, 3) to skew more randomly.}
}
\value{
a sample DF, the true average treatment effect, ATE0 and blip variance
BV0, the sample pscores, PGn, the sample true blips, blip_n, the sample 
true prob of death under treatment, PQ1n, and prob of death under control
PQ0n
}
\description{
randomly creates a dgp and attempts to satisfy user specs. Number of covariates
is not limited but may take a while beyond d = 20 with too many terms. Limit time with depth
and maxterms parameters.

# population having propensity scores below .05 or above .95, 1 binary, up to 1 interaction terms and at least 1
# term included as a covariate in outcome regression and in treatment mechanism
